# KSP Craft Files

These craft files were built under the following setup (2020/06/14):
- KSP 1.8.1
- recent BDB dev branch
- recent MLP dev branch
- ProbesPlus
- KSRSS

All the craft (except Cassini) have been flown on their intended missions in KSRSS, and so are somewhat tested, but YMMV.

Notes (all flight notes based on KSRSS, which is similar to JNSQ in scale)

Explorer - Not a trivial flight due to redstone and SRM-based upper stages. For science, my goal is Ap above "space high" and Pe below it. Upper stages are thrust limited to keep G forces low (I play with part G forces on). Use 1st stage to establish Ap. An ascent profile that keeps Gs below the red should yield an Ap of ~500-600k. Set maneuver node at Ap, with new Ap as high as you want or whatever the SRM's afford. Should definitely be able to reach above 1000km. For realism points (I guess?) at about T-10 before maneuver, turn off SAS, stage spin motor, wait for stage ejection, then stage the first SRM on time.

Vanguard - Unstable near air. Enough dV in the 3rd stage for Earth escape velocity I think ... but it's supposed to be in orbit, so 0 cuts off the SRM. 

Pioneer - I honestly don't know a ton about this mission, but the craft has enough dV to get into LEO and then lower Pe to at least Venus altitude.

MR-3 - Since I play with part and Kerbal G forces on, I fly this fairly shallow to avoid excessive G's on re-entry.
MA-6 - In KSRSS I'm typically shooting for 100x100(ish) with the Atlas. Retros used for de-orbit.

Ranger 4 - Friznit's incredibly valuable Wiki doesn't show the EIA, but in my experience the EDA1/2 do nothing on their own so I added it. The SRM "landing" is challenging!

Mariner - This has enough dV to get an encounter with Mars. I modeled the probe's build on some photos.

Gemini 8 - I put 4 OAMS thrusters on the Gemini capsule, so remove 2 if you want. Note that the staging of the 2nd stage is not totally accurate -- I believe the engine is to be ignited prior to separation. Not sure!

Agena Target Vehicle - Includes materials bay and experiments. Doesn't have any running lights.

Surveyor - In KSRSS, this build has enough dV to enter LEO (I think the real missions were direct ascent), perform a TLI on the Centaur, and have enough to use it to slow a little on lunar descent. "0" will shut down and jettison the retro motor on the lander. Unclear if I have the retro motor placed correctly. Seems like it has room to be pushed up into the lander, but then the shroud is janky.

Cassini-Huygens - This is built as accurately as I know how. It does not have enough dV to Hohmann transfer directly to Saturn, which of course the real mission didn't do either. So maybe someone better at gravity assists could make this build work. For me, it's just a pretty build and getting it to LEO is fun!
