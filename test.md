# Science Planner

## What is it?
Science Planner assists you in selecting the optimal set of science experiments to take on your missions.

It does this by evaluating the experiments you have unlocked and comparing against what has already been run at your destination. If an experiment would yield science results at some point in your mission, the experiment is recommended.

## Usage

**Destination** - Select a celestial body as your destination. The list supports any installed planet packs.

**Collection Method** - Specify if you'll be returning your science data, or transmitting it.

**Situations** - Check each sitation you intend to visit. Note that selecting Land or Splash will automatically select the other situations.

**Biomes** - If you are targeting specific biomes, you can indicate that here. Select All biomes if you don't have an intended destination.

Each time you change an option, Science Planner will consult with R&D's Archive to determine which experiments are best suited to your itinerary, and present the list in the Recommended Experiments section.


## Options

**Include Launch Sequence** - turn on to include your home planet's Land, Fly Low, Fly High, Space Low and Space High situations in potential experiment locations.

**Minimum Science Yield** - Experiments that would yield less than this percentage of their total possible value are not included in recommendations.
